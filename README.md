# 🖼️ Gen AI – Image Generation using GAN

A **Generative AI project** focused on creating CIFAR-10–like images using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**.  
The custom model consists of a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**, trained end-to-end to produce realistic images and distinguish them from real ones.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Train a **custom GAN** model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
- Generate synthetic images resembling CIFAR-10 with unique variations.  
- Run training and generation seamlessly on **Jupyter Notebooks** or **Google Colab** (GPU-accelerated).  

---

## 🎯 Use Cases
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance datasets with synthetic images.  
- **Concept Exploration**: Experiment with new concepts and artistic expressions.  
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Create mock-ups and test interfaces using generated content.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Setup  
- Clone the repository.  
- Install Python dependencies: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, and other requirements in `requirements.txt`.  

### 2️⃣ Training  
- Open the Jupyter Notebook locally or upload it to **Google Colab**.  
- Run all cells to train the GAN model.  
- Use **GPU acceleration** (highly recommended).  

### 3️⃣ Image Generation  
- After training, use the trained model to generate new images.  
- Experiment with **latent space** parameters to explore diverse variations.  

---

## 📝 Notes
- No graphical user interface (GUI) is provided — interaction is via notebooks/Colab.  
- GPU acceleration significantly improves training speed.  
- Contributions welcome! Fork, enhance, and open pull requests.
